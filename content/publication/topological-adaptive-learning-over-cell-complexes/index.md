abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to adaptive learning from streaming flow signals defined over cell complexes, utilizing a topology-based least mean squares (LMS) strategy. By harnessing the principles of Hodge theory, we develop a topological LMS algorithm that efficiently gathers and integrates flow data across various edges and their neighboring cells at multiple levels. Through comprehensive theoretical examination, we elucidate the algorithm's stochastic behavior, outlining conditions that ensure stability in terms of mean and mean-square error. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulas for assessing the mean-square performance, highlighting how it is influenced by the underlying topological structure, sampling techniques, and data characteristics. Our empirical evaluations, using both synthetic and real-world network traffic datasets, validate our theoretical finding and demonstrate the superiority of our topological approach over traditional graph-based adaptive learning methods that overlook higher-order topological elements.
