I am a Postdoctoral Researcher under the supervision of Prof. Sergio Barbarossa at the Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET), Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. My research focuses on representation and learning methods grounded in algebraic topology and category theory, with applications to causal AI (in particular causal abstraction and causal discovery), probabilistic topological modeling, signal processing, and semantic communications.

I earned a Bachelor's degree in Theoretical Physics from Sapienza University of Rome in 2013, followed by a Master's degree in Physics of Complex Systems from the University of Turin in 2017. In 2024, I received a Ph.D. in Data Science from Sapienza University of Rome, under the supervision of Dr. Francesco Bonchi.

From 2017 to 2019, I worked as a Financial Data Scientist at Fondaco SGR in Turin, Italy. From 2020 to 2022, I was a Junior Researcher at the Algorithmic and Data Analytics Lab of the ISI Foundation in Turin. From 2022 to 2024, I conducted research activities within the Machine Learning Foundations team at CENTAI in Turin, led by Prof. Fabio Vitale.
