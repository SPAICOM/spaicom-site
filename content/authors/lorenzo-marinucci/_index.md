bio: My recent work focuses on adaptive learning models on cell and simplicial complexes, as well as on the representation and inference of Gaussian processes on these spaces. Looking ahead, I would like to deepen and extend my understanding of probabilistic and learning models on topological spaces in general, and explore their statistical and computational properties.
