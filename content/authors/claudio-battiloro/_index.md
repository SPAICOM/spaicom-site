Dr. Battiloro is a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the NSAPH group supervised by Prof. Francesca Dominici. He is part of the Harvard Data Science Initiative. He is a former Visiting Associate at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science in the AleLab group supervised by Prof. Alejandro Ribeiro. He received a M.Sc. cum laude (and recognized as a top 1.5% student) in Data Science and a Ph.D. cum laude in Information and Communication Technologies, both from Sapienza University of Rome, and both under the supervision of Prof. Paolo Di Lorenzo. Dr Battiloro's research interests include theory and methods for topological signal processing and deep learning, AI for healthy climate adaptation, and distributed stochastic optimization. He has over 40 publications, including papers published in top-tier journals (e.g., IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Journal of Machine Learning Research, IEEE Transactions on IoT, and IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking) and conferences (e.g., ICLR, ICML, ICASSP, NeurIPS, and IJCNN). Claudio received different awards, such as the IEEE SPS Italian Chapter Best M.Sc. Thesis Award (2020), the GTTI Best Ph.D. Thesis Award (2024), and the "Elio Di Claudio" Best Ph.D. Thesis Award (2025).
